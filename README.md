## Learning Activities & Resources
For week 1 practical, I decided to create a car washing business website. Since this week practical needed to create a website by using HTML and CSS, I revised CP1406, which is Web Design and Development subject in JCU. I also studied w3schools website to revise some specific areas or things I wanted to use in my website. Next, I watched one LinkedIn Learning video so that I can apply advanced and interactive designs,i.e.,css in my website.

I spend 4 hours for that practical. I write learning journey first and then I wrote html and css codes for my website. I checked everything and finished the practical in remaining time.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
In the process of developing my website, I've revisited HTML and CSS through resources like w3schools and LinkedIn Learning. This course provided valuable information, especially in areas I hadn't covered, such as advanced CSS techniques. These advanced skills are particularly useful for adding finer details to my websites, which I didn't fully grasp in my Web Design course. Reflecting on my learning strategy this week, I found that combining different approaches was highly effective. By initially diving into guides, then applying my knowledge through hands-on work, and subsequently returning to tutorials for deeper understanding, I could reinforce and expand my skills more comprehensively. This iterative approach to learning has proven to be more beneficial for me compared to a single method.
